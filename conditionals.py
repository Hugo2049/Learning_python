"""Starting with if, it works like this
   if <expr>:
        <statement>
    else: 
        <statement>"""


a = 4
b = 12

if a > b: 
    print('a is bigger than b')
else: 
    print('b is bigger than a')

#There is also elif but in my opinion would be better to use a switch maybe

#other way of writting the if are like this:
c = 'Jhon'
d = 'Chad'
if c == 'Chad': print('hi, your name is' + c); print('how are you?')
else: print("I don't know you ")
